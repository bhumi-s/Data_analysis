Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on the analysis of hotel booking data collected over three years to gain insights into customer behavior and booking trends. The primary objectives include understanding the patterns of bookings and cancellations, identifying customer preferences, and providing actionable insights for decision-making.

Key Highlights:
1. Data Collection and Cleaning:  
   - Processed three years of hotel booking data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for analysis.  
   - Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

2. Customer Segmentation:  
   - Categorized bookings by customer type: couples, singles, and families.  
   - Analyzed booking trends to identify the dominant customer group.  

3. Cancellation Analysis:  
   - Investigated cancellation patterns to identify which customer types cancel the most.  
   - Explored reasons for cancellations, such as mismatched room assignments or undesirable conditions.

4. Room Assignment Analysis:  
   - Studied the allocation of desired and undesired rooms to customers.  
   - Assessed the impact of room assignment on cancellations and customer satisfaction.  

5. Dashboard Creation:  
   - Designed interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics, including:  
     - Number of bookings by customer type.  
     - Cancellation rates across different segments.  
     - Trends in desired and undesired room assignments.  
   - Dashboards provide actionable insights for hotel management to improve operations and reduce cancellations.

6. Key Findings and Recommendations:  
   - Highlighted trends in customer behavior, booking preferences, and room assignment patterns.  
   - Suggested strategies to optimize room allocation and reduce cancellation rates, such as improving customer communication and offering incentives for early bookings.

This analysis equips hotel management with the tools and insights needed to enhance customer satisfaction, streamline operations, and boost profitability.
